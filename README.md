# FRC-Team-2530-Documentation
The Documentation website.

### Details
It converts the markdown in `/docs` to html, and then uses https://github.com/marketplace/actions/github-pages-overwriter to deploy to github-pages.

### Development
If you want to work on this project, [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) is highly recommended. 

```bash
dub # To generate the site in /output
http-server output/ # To run the server
```

### Adding pages
There is a [documentation page](https://michael-m-2983.github.io/FRC-Team-2530-Documentation/documentation/How-to-create-pages/) dedicated to this. 

You can also access this documentation page on github itself [here](https://github.com/michael-m-2983/FRC-Team-2530-Documentation/blob/master/docs/documentation/How-to-create-pages.md). (but it doesn't have the amazing css)
