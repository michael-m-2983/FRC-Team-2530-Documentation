# How to create pages

1. Clone this repository, or get a different way of pushing changes
2. Add a new markdown (`.md`) file in the docs folder. It usually makes sense for it to be in a subfolder.
3. Create a link to your page somewhere. The best location is index.md
4. Commit&push changes to github
5. Wait ~1 minute
6. Check the documentation website
