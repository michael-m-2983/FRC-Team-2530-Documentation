    <h1>PCM Troubleshooting</h1>
<p>As with most troubleshooting, this is mostly common sense.</p>
<p>First, you'll want to see what info you can gather from the device itself. Using the following diagram, try to narrow down the problem.</p>
<p>Amber indicates a sticky fault, more information of which can be gathered from Pheonix Tuner. Red (as the diagram says) indicates either problems with CAN, or if a solenoid light is on, a solenoid problem.

<p>Once you have done that (the fastest step), try to launch the diagnostic software Phoenix Tuner, assuming you haven't solved it yet.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you can connect over WiFi, great, that's the easiest way. If not, try to find yourself a USB-B to USB-A cable to connect directly to the RoboRio, and select RoboRio over USB from the Phoenix Tuner Diagnostic Server Address dropdown menu.</li>
<li>select the PCM from the upper "selected device" dropdown, and go to the Self-Test tab.</li>
<li>Press Self-Test at the bottom, and interpret the results. (This takes some common sense and reading comprehension.)</li>
</ul>
