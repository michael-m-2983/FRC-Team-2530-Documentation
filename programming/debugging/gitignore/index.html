    <h1><code>.gitignore</code> doesn't work</h1>
<p>This happens when the files you're trying to ignore have already been committed in the repository.</p>
<h1>How to fix</h1>
<ol>
<li>Remove the directories and files you want to be ignored. If some of these aren't autogenerated (you want to keep them), just move them somewhere else temporarily.</li>
<li>Create and push a commit to the affected branch of the repository.</li>
<li>For any directories or files that you chose to keep, move them back to their original locations.</li>
</ol>
