    <h1>Commands</h1>
<p>Commands are where the methods created in the subsystems are actually run. They're named with a short summary of what they do.</p>
<h3>To create a new command:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Right-click on the <code>commands</code> folder.</li>
<li>Go to the bottom of the context menu that appears and select "Create a new class/command".</li>
<li>In the input box that appears at the top, type/click <code>Command (New)</code>.</li>
<li>Give it a relevant name.</li>
</ol>
<h3>To add subsystem methods to a command:</h3>
<ol>
<li>You're going to need to <code>import</code> your subsystem methods before you can call them. In the command file, beneath the other <code>import</code>s, type <code>import frc.robot.subsystems.NAME;</code>, where <code>NAME</code> is the file name of your subsystem.</li>
<li>Now just call the methods from your subsystems inside the proper area of the command file.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>To call a method, type <code>NAME(PARAMETERS);</code>, where <code>NAME</code> is the method name and <code>PARAMETERS</code> are the inputs you defined the method to need.</li>
<li>The <code>initialize()</code> area will only run once -- when the command is called.</li>
<li>The <code>execute()</code> area will run repeatedly after the command has been called.</li>
<li>The <code>end()</code> area will run when the command is stopped.</li>
<li>The <code>isFinished()</code> area constantly evaluates the conditional after <code>return</code>, and when it's true, <code>end()</code> is run.</li>
</ul>
<h3>To call commands:</h3>
<p>You're not quite done yet! Commands don't just start doing things magically! The final step is to actually run the command.</p>
<ol>
<li>Locate the place where you want to run your command.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>If you're running the command in <code>RobotContainer.java</code>, you don't need to <code>import</code> the command, as it's already hooked up to do that. If you're running it somewhere else, beneath the other <code>import</code>s, type <code>import frc.robot.commands.NAME;</code>, where <code>NAME</code> is the name of the command.</li>
<li>A common scenario is hooking up your command to a joystick button. To do this, open <code>RobotContainer.java</code> (no need to <code>import</code>) and scroll down to the "Joysticks and Buttons" section. At the bottom of the "Joystick buttons" area, type <code>private final JoystickButton ButtonBUTTON = new JoystickButton(CONTROLLER, BUTTON);</code>, where <code>CONTROLLER</code> is the name of the controller and <code>BUTTON</code> is the ID of the button you want to link to (Google the controller if you're not sure what this is). Now scroll down to the <code>configureButtonBindings()</code> area and type <code>ButtonBUTTON</code>. If you want the command to run only once, type <code>.whenPressed();</code> -- otherwise, type <code>.whileHeld();</code>. Type Step 2 inside the parentheses.</li>
</ul>
<ol start=2>
<li>Type <code>new NAME()</code>, where <code>NAME</code> is the command's file name.</li>
</ol>
<h3>About instant commands</h3>
<p>If you only need to do a simple task (such as running a single method when a button is pressed) you don't have to go through the process of setting up an actual command. You can instead directly call those methods from the subsystem. Instead of typing <code>new NAME()</code>, type <code>() -> VARNAME.FUNCNAME()</code>, where <code>VARNAME</code> is the name of the subsystem's <strong>variable</strong> and <code>FUNCNAME</code> is the name of the method in the subsystem you want to run. If you want to pass parameters, you have to put them inside the first set of parentheses.</p>

<p>If you've made it this far, you've learned almost all the basics of FRC programming! The final step before putting it into practice is learning more about <a href="https://github.com/Team2530/Documentation/wiki/Constants">constants</a>.</p>
