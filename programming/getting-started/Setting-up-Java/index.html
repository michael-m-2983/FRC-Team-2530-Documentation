<h1>(Deprecated) Setting up Java</h1>
<h3>THIS ARTICLE IS DEPRECIATED. You no longer need to manually install Java, as it is bundled with the <a href="https://github.com/Team2530/Documentation/wiki/Setting-up-VSCode">WPILib VSCode installation</a>.</h3>
<hr>
<p>This one has a couple steps to it, you need both the JRE and JDK to program.</p>
<h4>Note: one consideration you have to make is that all laptops are running that same version of Java; this way we can rule out mismatched versions of Java for causing problems with code.</h4>
<p>Since it would be troublesome to update the links all the time, just look up the download pages for the Java 8 JRE and JDK.</p>
<p>Once both are installed, you should be good.</p>
