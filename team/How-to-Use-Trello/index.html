    <h1>How to use Trello</h1>
<p>Our team uses Trello to keep track of, discuss, and stay on top of tasks. It's important for all members to regularly check the boards so that everyone knows what to do!</p>
<h1>Essential steps</h1>
<p>Check that you've accomplished all of these, even if you're already using Trello!</p>
<h3>Join the team</h3>
<ol>
<li>If you haven't already, create a Trello account at <a href="https://trello.com">trello.com</a>.</li>
<li>Go to our Discord server and look for the Trello team invite link, or ask for it if you can't find it.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now you have access to all of the team's boards whenever you click the home button in the top-left corner. There's a main team board and boards for specific subteams.</p>
<h3>Change your nickname</h3>
<p>In a real-life collaboration, it's vital that team members are identifiable. It's even more helpful if they can be identified at a glance by their icons/initials.</p>
<ol>
<li>In the upper-right corner, click the circle with your username's initials. Click on "Settings".</li>
<li>You'll see a notice about your Atlassian account. Click the link that says "go to your Atlassian account".</li>
<li>On the page that opens, scroll down to the "About me" section and change the <strong>full name</strong> to your first name and last name/initial. <strong>Changing your public name has no effect in Trello!</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>It's also helpful to change your username (also known as your Trello handle) to something recognizable for when people mention you in comments and such. To do this:</p>
<ol>
<li>In the upper-right corner, click the circle with your username's initials. Click on "Profile and Visibility".</li>
<li>Scroll down to the About section.</li>
<li>Using the Username box, enter a username that includes your first name and last initial, at least. Note that your username won't be as recognizable as your nickname due to certain constraints imposed by Trello.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Join your boards</h3>
<p>This will allow you to be notified of new board activity via email and be available for joining tasks.</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the Main Team Board.</li>
<li>On the top-center of the screen, you'll see a bunch of icons with a "Join Board" button to the right of it. Click that button!</li>
<li>Repeat for each subteam that you're a member of.</li>
</ol>
<p>You have access to all of the Team 2530 boards you've joined whenever you click the Boards button in the top-left corner and scroll to the bottom. You can also star these boards using the Star button on the upper-left corner of a board to pin them to the top of this list.</p>
<h1>How to use Trello</h1>
<p>Again, even if you already use Trello, read through this section to take advantage of all the features our team is using!</p>
<h3>Joining a task</h3>
<ol>
<li>Open the task you want to join.</li>
<li>Press the "Join" button in the top-right corner of the view.</li>
</ol>
<p>You'll automatically begin "watching" the card, which will enable notifications for that card. You can also watch cards without joining them by scrolling down in the view and selecting "Watch" in the bottom-right corner.</p>
<h3>Adding a task</h3>
<ol>
<li>Open the board you want to add the task to.</li>
<li>Find the list you want to add the task to. For example, a task that hasn't been started would go in the "Not Started" list.</li>
<li>Go to the bottom of the list and click "+ Add another card". Type in what you want the card to say (a brief overview of what needs to be done) and hit the enter key.</li>
<li>Click on the main body of the card to open the description view.</li>
<li>Elaborate on what needs to be done by adding a description. Include links and possible discussion points. You can also add attachments by clicking the Attachment button on the right-hand side of the view.</li>
<li>Add team members to the card by clicking "Members" on the right-hand side of the view and searching for their names.</li>
<li>Add a due date to the card by clicking "Due Date" on the right-hand side of the view and selecting a date/time. (Non-deadline-focused tasks don't need a due date.)</li>
<li>Once you're done, just close the card: it will save automatically.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can edit some aspects of the card very quickly by selecting the pencil icon when hovering over the card.</p>
<p>If you're filling out a part request on the Parts Ordering board, don't click "+ Add another card", but click the "Create from template" button directly to the right of it and select "Part Request Template". You can then fill in the necessary information.</p>
<h3>Moving cards</h3>
<p>Whenever a task's progress advances, the card needs to be updated promptly to best communicate with your team members.</p>
<ol>
<li>To change the progress of a card, just drag it to its destination.</li>
<li>You can reorder cards vertically to indicate priority or chronological order.</li>
<li>To move a card to a different board, select the pencil icon while hovering over the card and select "Move". You can only move cards to boards that you have joined.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Viewing the calendar</h3>
<p>The calendar is board-specific and shows all of the upcoming tasks that are due in a traditional calendar format.</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the board you want to view the calendar for.</li>
<li>On the upper-right corner of the screen, you'll see a button that says "Calendar". Click that button!</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>The view will default to Month. If there are a lot of tasks to view -- such as during build season -- you can switch to the Week view using the option in the upper-right corner.</li>
<li>Click on a day to expand that view. You can also add tasks from here if you feel like adding tasks chronologically by due date.</li>
<li>To switch weeks or months, use the arrows in the upper-left corner. To switch back to the current week, press the Today button.</li>
</ul>
